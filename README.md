#lks-indicator

##Description
Lock Keys Status indicator displays status of the Caps, Num, or Scroll lock keys. It is written for Ubuntu with Unity desktop , and has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 , although Xubuntu users also have reported it as working.

## Motivation for the project
Originally this has been written as an answer for ByteCommander's question on Ask Ubuntu site: [Keyboard LED panel indicator for Unity Desktop](http://askubuntu.com/q/796985/295286) . Eventually it has been decided to turn it into standalone project.
